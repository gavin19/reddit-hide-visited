reddit-hide-visited
===================

Hide visited links on the current page via pageAction (Snoo in the address bar).

Very simple extension that polls the current front page of reddit/a subreddit and
hides any posts that appear in the user's history.

Rudimentary whitelist option primarily for mods who don't necessarily want to hide posts
from those specificied subreddits.

Needs work but it's functional (for now!).
